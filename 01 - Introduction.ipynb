Any violation of the School’s policy on Academic and Professional Integrity (stated in the Master’s and Doctoral Student Handbooks) will result in serious penalties, which might range from failing an assign­ment, to failing a course, to being expelled from the program. Violations of academic and professional integrity will be reported to UMSI Student Affairs.
